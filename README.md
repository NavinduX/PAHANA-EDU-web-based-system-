✅ 3-tier architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend (Presentation Layer):

JSP (JavaServer Pages) → For dynamic web pages

CSS → For styling and layout

JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library) → For UI logic simplification

Backend (Business Logic Layer):

Java Servlets → Handle requests and responses

Service Classes → Encapsulate business logic (e.g., BillService, CustomerService)

DAO Pattern (Data Access Object) → Database communication layer

Database (Data Access Layer):

MySQL → Relational database storing customers, items, users, and bills

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) → Connect Java Servlets to MySQL

Server & Deployment:

Apache Tomcat → Web server to run Servlets & JSP

WAR Deployment → Packaged web archive for deployment

Version Control & Collaboration:

Git & GitHub → Version control and collaborative development

🧩 Design Patterns Used

DAO Pattern → Data access operations (CRUD for Customers, Items, Bills)

Singleton Pattern → DB connection pooling

MVC Pattern → Separation of UI, business logic, and data

Factory Pattern → Bill & Report generation
